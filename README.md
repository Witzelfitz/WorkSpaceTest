# WorkSpaceTest

This project sets up a frontend environment for a simple CV one-pager using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to provide a basic structure for displaying a CV online with interactive elements.

## Viewing the CV Page

To view the CV page in a browser, open the `index.html` file. This file serves as the entry point to the CV page, which is styled by `styles.css` and made interactive with `script.js`.

## Live Preview via GitHub Pages

To enable a live preview of the CV page, follow these steps to activate GitHub Pages for this repository:
1. Go to the repository settings on GitHub.
2. Navigate to the "Pages" section.
3. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`) and the folder (`/ (root)`).
4. Click "Save" to activate GitHub Pages.

Once activated, the CV page will be accessible at the URL generated by GitHub, which typically follows the format `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`. For example, the live preview of this CV page can be viewed at `[https://witzelfitz.github.io/WorkSpaceTest](https://Witzelfitz.github.io/WorkSpaceTest/)`.

## Tic Tac Toe Game

To play the Tic Tac Toe game, navigate to the `tic-tac-toe.html` subpage. This game is implemented using best practices in HTML, CSS, and ECMAScript 6 to ensure a modern and efficient gaming experience.
