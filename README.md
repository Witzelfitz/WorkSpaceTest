# WorkSpaceTest

This project sets up a frontend environment for a simple CV one-pager using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to provide a basic structure for displaying a CV online with interactive elements.

## Viewing the CV Page

To view the CV page in a browser, open the `index.html` file. This file serves as the entry point to the CV page, which is styled by `styles.css` and made interactive with `script.js`.
